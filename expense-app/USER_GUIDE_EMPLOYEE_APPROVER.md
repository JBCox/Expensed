# Jensify – Guide for Employees and Approvers

This guide explains how to use the Jensify app step by step.  
It is written for people who are not technical and may have never used an expense app before.  
**Important:** Jensify is now report-based. You upload receipts → create expenses → add them into an expense report → submit the report for approval. Individual expenses are not submitted on their own.

You will learn:

- What you see when you sign in.
- What happens when you click each main button or menu item.
- What features are available for:
  - People who submit expenses (employees).
  - People who review and approve expenses (approvers/finance).

---

## 1. What You See on the Screen

When you sign in, the screen is divided into three main parts:

1. **Top bar (across the top)**
   - On the left: the **Jensify logo**.
   - In the middle: space for search (this may be used later).
   - On the right: your **name and email**, a **bell icon** for notifications, and a **menu** where you can sign out.

2. **Side menu (on the left)**
   - This is also called the **navigation bar**.
   - It contains buttons like:
     - Dashboard
     - Upload Receipt
     - Receipts
     - My Expenses
     - New Expense
     - Approvals (for approvers/finance)
     - Finance Dashboard (for finance)
   - The side menu can be:
     - **Expanded** – shows icons and words.
     - **Collapsed** – shows icons only, to save space.

3. **Main area (center of the screen)**
   - This area changes depending on what you click.
   - For example, it shows your dashboard, a list of expenses, or an approval queue.

All text fields (such as email, password, amount, notes) are designed so the label sits above the line, and the typing area is clearly visible and easy to read.

## 2. How the App Works for Employees

This section explains what happens for someone who is entering their own expenses.

### 2.1 Signing In

1. Open the Jensify website.
2. Enter your **email** and **password**.
3. Click **Sign In**.
4. After signing in, you land on your **Dashboard**.

If you ever need to leave the app, click your name in the top right and choose **Sign Out**.

### 2.2 Dashboard – Your Home Screen

When you sign in, you see the **Dashboard**.

On this page you will usually see:

- A greeting, for example: “Hi, Alex”.
- **Quick buttons** such as:
  - **Add Receipt** – takes you to the screen where you upload a new receipt.
  - **New Expense** – takes you to the form to create a new expense.
- **Summary cards** that show:
  - **Unreported expenses** (draft expenses you have not added to a report yet).
  - **Draft reports** (reports you are still editing).
  - **Submitted reports** (waiting for manager/finance review).
  - **Approved (unpaid) reports** (waiting for reimbursement).
- A **“Next steps” box** that tells you what you should do next (for example, upload a receipt or create an expense).
- A **recent activity list** showing your latest expenses with date, amount, and status.

From here you can click:

- **Add Receipt** – to upload a new receipt.
- **New Expense** – to make a new expense.
- Or use the **side menu** to go to any other section.

### 2.3 Upload Receipt – Saving a Receipt in the System

Side menu button: **Upload Receipt**

Use this when you have a **photo or file of a receipt** and you want to save it in Jensify.

On the **Upload Receipt** page:

1. You see an area asking you to drop a file or choose a file.
2. You can:
   - **Drag and drop** a file (for example from your desktop) into this area, or
   - Click a button to **browse** and select a file from your computer or phone.
3. The app checks:
   - That it is an allowed type of file (for example, an image or PDF).
   - That it is not too large.
4. Click **Upload** (or the button shown to start uploading).
5. After the upload finishes:
   - The receipt is saved in your **Receipts** list.
   - You are automatically sent to the **New Expense** page.

You can upload receipts first, then create the expenses, or you can attach receipts later from your Receipts list.

### 2.4 New Expense – Creating an Expense

Side menu button: **New Expense**  
You may also arrive here automatically right after uploading a receipt.

On the **New Expense** page, you fill out a form for a single expense.

You will see fields such as:

- **Merchant** – where you spent the money (example: “Uber”, “Staples”).
- **Amount** – how much you spent.
- **Category** – type of expense (example: “Travel”, “Meals”, “Office Supplies”).
- **Date** – the date of the expense.
- **Notes** – any details you want to add (optional).

#### 2.4.1 When You Came from Uploading a Receipt

If you just uploaded a receipt, an **Attached Receipt** box appears on this page. It shows:

- The **file name**.
- The **type** of file (image, PDF, etc.).
- The **size** of the file.
- A **View** button:
  - Opens the receipt in a new browser tab so you can see it.
- A **Remove** button:
  - Disconnects this receipt from this expense.
  - The receipt is not deleted; it stays in your Receipts library.

#### 2.4.2 Attaching or Changing a Receipt from the Expense Form

If you do not have a receipt attached yet (or want to change it), look for a button such as **Attach receipt** or **Change receipt**.

When you click it:

1. A small window (a dialog) opens with two tabs:
   - **Upload New** – upload a new receipt file.
   - **Choose Existing** – pick a receipt you already uploaded earlier.
2. If you choose **Upload New**:
   - You select a file and upload it.
   - After the upload, the window closes and that receipt is attached to your expense.
3. If you choose **Choose Existing**:
   - You see a list of your receipts.
   - Each item shows the file name, type, and size.
   - You click **Select** on the one you want.
   - The window closes and the receipt is attached to your expense.

You can remove a receipt from the expense form at any time; it will still be available in your Receipts list.

#### 2.4.3 Saving the Expense

When you have filled in the fields you need:

1. Click the button to **save** or **create** the expense.
2. The expense is saved with a **Draft** status and is considered **Unreported** until you place it into a report.
3. You will be able to see it on:
   - Your **Dashboard**.
   - The **My Expenses** page (with a tag such as “Unreported”).

Remember: draft expenses are **not** submitted to anyone. The next step is to add them to an **expense report** (see section 2.7) and submit the report.

### 2.5 Receipts – Your Receipt Library

Side menu button: **Receipts**

The **Receipts** page shows every receipt file you have uploaded.

On this page:

- Each receipt is shown with:
  - An icon.
  - The file name.
  - The file type.
  - The file size.
- For each receipt you can:
  - Click **View** – opens the file in a new browser tab.
  - Click **Create Expense** – takes you straight to the **New Expense** page with that receipt already attached.

This is useful if you uploaded a lot of receipts and want to create expenses for them later.

### 2.6 My Expenses – Viewing and Filtering Your Expenses

Side menu button: **My Expenses**

The **My Expenses** page shows a list of all the expenses you have created.

On this page you can:

- See each expense with:
  - Whether it has a receipt attached (thumbnail or icon).
  - Merchant, date, category, and notes.
  - A **status badge**:
    - Draft
    - Submitted
    - Approved
    - Reimbursed
    - Rejected
  - The amount.
- A **Report** tag that tells you whether the expense is:
  - **Unreported** (still a standalone draft), or
  - Assigned to a specific report (shows the report name/status).
- Use filters to narrow the list:
  - By status (for example, only Draft or only Approved).
  - By merchant or notes (search bar).
  - By category.
  - By date range.
  - By amount range.

For each expense, you typically see buttons like:

- **View Receipt**
  - If there is a receipt attached:
    - Opens the receipt in a new tab.
  - If there is no receipt:
    - The button is disabled and may say “No Receipt”.
- **View Details**
  - This will later take you to a page with full details for that expense.
  - For now it may be just a visual placeholder.
- **Edit**
  - This will later let you change the expense.
  - For now it may be a placeholder.
- **Add to Report…**
  - Opens a dialog where you can choose one of your draft reports (or create a new one) and move the selected expenses into that report.

At the top or bottom of the page, you may also see an option to **Export to CSV** (a spreadsheet file):

- This creates a file that you can open in Excel or Google Sheets.
- It includes:
  - Each expense that matches your filters.
  - Fields like ID, merchant, amount, category, date, status.
  - Whether a receipt is attached.
  - Receipt file name and link.

### 2.7 Reports – Bundling Expenses and Submitting for Approval

Side menu button: **Reports**

Reports are the containers you submit for approval. Every expense must live inside a report (even a single expense).

**Creating a report**

1. Open the **Reports** page and click **New report**.
2. Give the report a name (for example “March 2025 client travel”) and optionally a date range or description.
3. Select the draft expenses you want to include. You can:
   - Check multiple unreported expenses and add them in bulk, or
   - Start with an empty report and add/remove lines later.
4. Save. The report status is **Draft** until you submit it.

**Working on a draft report**

- Open a draft to review every line item.
- You can add or remove expenses at any time while the report is draft.
- All expenses must meet policy requirements:
  - Required fields (merchant, amount, category, date) must be filled in.
  - Receipts must be attached; the app blocks submission if any line is missing a receipt.
- The total at the top updates automatically whenever you change the lines.

**Submitting a report**

1. When everything looks correct, click **Submit report**.
2. Jensify double-checks that the report has at least one expense and that each expense has a receipt.
3. After submission, the status changes to **Submitted**, and the report appears in the Approvals queue.
4. While a report is Submitted/Approved/Rejected/Paid you cannot edit its expenses (unless it is rejected and you make a new draft).

You can always see your reports (Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Paid) on the Reports page, along with total amounts and timestamps.
Jensify automatically creates a draft “Month Year Expenses” report for you each month and drops new draft expenses into it, so you always have a ready-to-submit bundle.

## 3. How the App Works for Approvers and Finance

Some people have extra permissions because they are managers, approvers, or part of the finance team. They see everything employees see, plus extra options.

### 3.1 Approvals – Reviewing Submitted Reports

Side menu button: **Approvals**  
(Visible for managers, approvers, finance, or admin roles.)

The **Approvals** page now shows **Submitted reports** instead of single expenses.

On this page:

- Each row displays the report name, the employee who created it, submission date, number of expenses, and the total amount.
- Status chips indicate whether each report is Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, or Paid.
- A search box lets you filter by employee or report name. When you select reports, batch buttons for **Approve Selected** and **Reject Selected** appear.

For each report you can:

- Select it and click **Approve**. This changes the report status to Approved and moves it to the finance queue.
- Select it and click **Reject** (add a short note if you like). The report goes back to the employee as Draft so they can fix issues—missing receipts are already blocked earlier, so rejections usually cover policy notes such as “wrong category”.
- Because submission requires receipts on every expense line, approvers don’t have to chase employees for missing files.

### 3.2 Finance Dashboard – Reimbursing Approved Reports

Side menu button: **Finance Dashboard**  
(Visible for finance or admin roles.)

The Finance Dashboard lists **Approved** reports that have not yet been reimbursed.

You see:

- Cards/rows for each report showing employee name, report name, number of expenses, approval date, and the total amount awaiting payment.
- Metrics summarizing how many reports remain and the total dollar amount.

For each report you can:

- Click **Mark as Reimbursed** to change the report status to Paid/Reimbursed and remove it from the queue.
- Select multiple reports and use **Mark Selected Reimbursed** for batch payouts after a pay run.
- Click **Export to CSV** to download a per-expense spreadsheet. Each CSV row includes the report info, employee info, merchant, category, amount, and signed receipt URLs (valid for 24 hours) so finance can attach the supporting documents to their accounting records.

## 4. Understanding Statuses

### Expense statuses

Expenses themselves still carry a status, but it now mirrors the report they belong to:

- **Draft** – the expense exists but has not yet been placed into a submitted report (shown as “Unreported” in lists).
- **Submitted** – the expense lives inside a Submitted report.
- **Approved** – the parent report was approved; the expense inherits that status.
- **Reimbursed** – the parent report was marked Paid/Reimbursed.
- **Rejected** – the parent report was rejected and returned to the employee.

You generally edit expenses only while they are Draft/Unreported (or after a report is rejected).

### Report statuses

- **Draft**
  - The employee is still building the report. They can add/remove expenses freely.
- **Submitted**
  - The report is waiting for approval. Editing is locked until a decision is made.
- **Approved**
  - An approver/manager accepted the report. It now appears on the Finance Dashboard for payout.
- **Paid / Reimbursed**
  - Finance has marked the report as reimbursed.
- **Rejected**
  - The reviewer rejected the report (usually with a short note). The employee can edit and resubmit after fixing the issue.

Receipts are stored separately and attached to expenses. If you remove a receipt from an expense, the file itself is still saved in your **Receipts** library and can be used again.

---

## 5. In Summary

- **Employees**
  - Upload receipts, create expenses, and drop each expense into a report.
  - When a report is ready, submit it so the entire bundle moves through Submitted → Approved → Reimbursed.
  - Use the Dashboard for cues (“unreported expenses”, “draft reports”), **My Expenses** to see which report each line belongs to, and **Reports** to manage drafts/submissions.

- **Approvers**
  - Open **Approvals** to see whole reports waiting for review.
  - Approve good reports with one click or reject them with a short note so the employee can fix and resubmit.

- **Finance**
  - Work from the **Finance Dashboard**, which lists approved reports and keeps totals up to date.
  - Mark reports reimbursed in bulk and export detailed CSVs (with signed receipt links) for accounting records.

Jensify keeps the flow simple: capture receipts → create expenses → build reports → submit → approve → reimburse. Clear badges, counts, and exports help every role know exactly what to do next.
When something changes (for example, a report is approved, rejected, or reimbursed), an in-app notification appears the next time you open the Reports page—assuming you’ve left those notification preferences enabled.
